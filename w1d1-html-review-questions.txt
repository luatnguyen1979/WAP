-	What is a TCP port?
An easy way to understand ports is to imagine your IP address is a cable box and the ports are the different channels on that cable box. The cable company knows how to send cable to your cable box based upon a unique serial number associated with that box (IP Address), and then you receive the individual shows on different channels (Ports).

-	What is multiplexing (regarding tcp ports)
Multiple programs using the same IP address

-	What is the difference between a browser and a web server?  How do they work together?
In order for a web server to accept connections from remote computers, such as yourself, it must bind the web server application to a local port. it will then use this port to listen for and accept connections from remote computers. Web servers typically bind to the TCP port 80, which is what the http protocol uses by default, and then will wait and listen for connections from remote devices. Once a device is connected, it will send the requested web pages to the remote device, and when done, disconnect the connection.
On the other hand, if you are remote user using a browser to connect to a web server. Your web browser would pick a random TCP port from a certain range of port numbers, and attempt to connect to port 80 on the IP address of the web server. When the connection is established, the web browser will send the request for a particular web page and receive it from the web server. Then both computers will disconnect the connection.

-	How is HTTP related to HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a well known mark up language used to develop web pages. It has been around for a long time and is commonly used in webpage design. HTTP, on the other hand, stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a means of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

-	What does it mean if a URL starts with a / ?  with a file name?  with a .. ?
