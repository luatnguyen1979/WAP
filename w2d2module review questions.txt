Review Questions

Give an example of creating an object literal?
var pt = {
'x': 4,
'y': 3

Show how to add a new property to an object literal.
- Use dot syntax to add a new property to it as follows: obj.prop2 = 'data here';

How is the 'this' keyword used in a JavaScript object?
- this is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code .

What do the 'for of' and 'for in' loops do and how are they different? 
- Both for..of and for..in statements iterate over lists; 
	+ for..in returns a list of keys on the object being iterated,
	+ for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

What does 'this' refer to in an event handler?  Answer: it always refer to the invoker

How are call and apply related? Answer: when you want to invoke the function immediately, and modify the context

How does bind relate to call?
What is 'function borrowing'?  Answer: This is using a defined function from an object using binding. Can it be done in Java? Yes, it is interface in Java.

What is the difference of the revealing module pattern and the module factory example?
revealing module pattern is an object and the module factory is an function.
Exmaple:
RMP:	var counter = (function() {
            var privateCounter = 0; //private data
            function changeBy(val) { //private inner function
                privateCounter += val;
            }
            function value() {
                return privateCounter;
            }
            return {value:value}
        })();
MF:
        var makeCounter = function() {
            var privateCounter = 0;
            function changeBy(val) {
                privateCounter += val;
            }
            function value() {
                return privateCounter;
            }
